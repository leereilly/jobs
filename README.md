The Job

Are you passionate about artificial intelligence, data mining, and the web? Wondered what it would have been like to join Google in the early days?

Scribd is building a new team to tackle a still-confidential project that involves crawling a large subset of the web and mining it for structured data. This is an engineer&rsquo;s playground of interesting technical problems and a great opportunity to get involved at the ground floor of a new product.

The Ideal Profile

We&rsquo;re looking to add people with varied experience levels, from seasoned veterans of web crawling to talented engineers who can learn fast and would like to try something new.

The ideal candidate is someone who loves the web and web technologies, but rather than continuing to build their own sites is interested in helping to make the web more useful by understanding the data already there. Building a great web crawling operation is a combination of formal artificial intelligence techniques, system scalability problems, and clever heuristics with a helping of good judgement. For the right person, this should sound like a really fun problem.

Responsibilities

Work with team to develop software that can mine structured data from the web
Continually test, refine, and improve the accuracy of extraction technology
Develop and scale a distributed web crawling engine
Use a combination of formal and heuristic techniques to cover the largest possible set of cases with the minimum amount of effort

Qualifications

Strong understanding of web technologies &ndash; HTML, CSS, Javascript
Strong overall engineering background &ndash; as evidenced by a degree in CS or equivalent industry experience
Follow technology trends and have an understanding of the overall web ecosystem &ndash; web advertising and economics, major players
Familiarity with artificial intelligence and data mining techniques
Not an astronaut architect &ndash; good at producing simple &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; solutions to complex problems
Ideally: direct experience with web data mining or web crawling

Gravity Mobile is a boutique mobile development shop in the SOMA district of SF. We develop innovative server backed mobile applications with beautiful user experiences for iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, and BREW devices.

We have an expanding stable of products including MusicID [iPhone|Android|Others] and LyricsID [iPhone]. We also do interesting projects for large telecom, media, and device companies.

Engineering Environment   

We value good object oriented design and highly readable code. We work in a fast paced environment, using newer infrastructure tools and processes when they better meet our needs, and proven strategies when they don&rsquo;t. Right now we are utilizing daily stand up meetings, unit testing and code reviewing as needed, organizing projects in Basecamp, tracking time in Harvest, and of course managing and versioning source in GitHub hosted git.

Our teams are small so all individuals have vertical responsibilities and work on tasks that have immediate, visible impact. We have daily core hours in an open office plan, so we often work through problems together, face to face in front of a whiteboard. We also value compelling, intuitive user interfaces, so we work closely with our in house designers when building out UI.

Our backends primarily power REST-style JSON and XML APIs that provide data to native mobile clients. However, we do make some web front ends using jQuery, usually for administration and reporting. Our backends also consume REST and SOAP based web services from our upstream data providers. Our infrastructure is built from Linux VMs, replicated MySQL databases, Apache, and Python modules. We make use of the Django framework where applicable.

We work on Macbook Pro or Thinkpad laptops with good sized external monitors on big desks. We sit in Aeron or Mirra chairs. We have kitchens stocked with drinks and snacks. We are a friendly group of people and have a lot of fun working hard together.

Developer Responsibilities   

Work out of our office and be willing to engage with team members on very collaborative development efforts. Depending on your position, lead a small team or work well within that team. Either way, self motivation and good communication skills are key.

Learn old codebases and architect new software modules. Efficiently implement new features and bug fixes. Update old database schemas and design new database schemas as needed.

Design elegant, intuitive APIs with consideration for long term architectural implications and the unique requirements of resource limited mobile clients.

Work with operations staff to design and implement failsafe mechanisms to ensure maximum uptime for our services.

Required Qualifications:   


B.S. in Computer Science with some professional experience or 4+ years of degree equivalent experience
Solid understanding of algorithms, data structures, and data storage fundamentals
Experience with SQL based server development and database administration in production systems
Experience programming with the MVC pattern in a modern, dynamic, object-oriented language
Able to professionally communicate with clients and coworkers on the phone, in email, and in person

The Job

Love your iPhone? Have little or no experience building iPhone applications, but want to learn? You may have just found a perfect opportunity.

Scribd is already one of the largest applications on the web, and now we are making an aggressive push into mobile. We believe that existing mobile reading experiences do not take full advantage of the power of the new smartphones, and that we can do a better job. With our library of over 150 million articles, our mobile apps will give consumers access to more written content than any other app currently available.

We are building out a terrific mobile team with experience in both iPhone and Android platforms to create these applications.

This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to get into mobile app development.

The Ideal Profile

We are looking for people with a strong engineering background who enjoy building high quality products used by millions. Because Objective C is based on C, a strong understanding of C/C++ development and memory management are required. A good product sense, an understanding of the mobile app ecosystem, and strong personal initiative are essential.

Responsibilities

Mobile development on iOS. Design, architect, implement, and QA Scribd’s new mobile apps. Work creatively to solve challenging problems.

Qualifications 

1+ years work experience as a software engineer 

Computer Science degree or equivalent experience 

Understanding of scalability, systems engineering, and algorithms 

Strong knowledge of C/C++ 

Understanding of memory management 

Prior knowledge of Objective C, Mac development, or iOS development is a plus but not required
